        <strong> Delta Investment Management (2014 - 2015) </strong>
        <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top:-10px;">
            <p> My first job was at Delta Investment Management working under my dad and his business partner.  I wrote
                Excel VBA programs to retrieve historical stock data for securities and backtest strategies. The
                strategies we developed are still used today, and I occasionally do work for Delta to update old code.

        <strong> Southern Glazers Wine and Spirits (Sep 2017 - Dec 2018) </strong>
        <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top:-10px;">
            <p> My first job after graduating was working as a data analyst at Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits.  I
                made sales reports using SQL and VBA and wrote python/VBA scripts to automate invoice filing.  I
                really enjoyed learning SQL and writing scripts, but disliked report making.  I was put on a project to
                build a database of sales discounts by manually entering in thousands of non standardized deals into a
                SQL table.  I decided it was time to get a new job.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was searching for similar positions, until my friend Kiarash Mavandad called to tell me
                about an opening at his company, Badger Meter, for a software engineering position.  I never
                considered working as a software engineer because I lacked the qualifications, but his call opened up
                my mind to the possibility.  I applied and was rejected due to my lack of knowledge and experience,
                but I began working towards becoming a software engineer.  I spent the next 2 months coding as much as I
                could. My hard work paid off when Badger Meter decided to re-interview me and gave me the job.  I moved
                out of my parents place to live in San Jose and start my new career as a Software Engineer.  I was
                beyond excited!

        <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top:-10px;">
            <p> I have been working for Badger Meter since December 2018. I worked as an intern for 3 months and was
                then hired full time after my internship.  I am currently a Senior Software Engineer and team lead for
                the Analytics team, which does analytics on sensor data from water meters.  I work on back end
                development in Python and DevOps in AWS.  I really enjoy the work and have made thousands of contributions
                to the Github Badger Meter Organization.

                I built this game to learn React and Javascript when I was learning to code. One day I hope to
                make a new version in python using Object Oriented Programming.  Here is the source

                <p> One of my passions outside of work is chess.  My dad taught me the rules when I was young.
                    I didn't play much growing up, but started playing in the college dorms when students
                    set up boards in the hallways. I created my <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/catkeson">chess.com account</a> the summer
                    after my freshman year and played my <a href="https://www.chess.com/game/live/850313218">first online game</a>
                    on July 2, 2014.  I worked my way up from a 600 rating to a peak rating of 2374 and went from
                    the 5th percentile of players on the site to the 99.9th percentile.  I started playing tournament chess
                    in 2019 at the Kolty Chess club. I have played about 50 over the board games and have a rating of
                    2064.  My goal is to become a National Master by reaching a rating of 2200.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is a win I had against GM Gata Kamsky in a simultaneous exhibition.  Gata was playing several
                    players at once and wanted to go to bed so the timing was on my side! I found an unusual tactic in
                    the opening which gave me a winning advantage.  Gata came close to recovering, but I was able
                    to hold on to my advantage long enough to win the game.  I have been a fan of Gata since I started
                    playing chess.

                <p> Though I don't have much to show for it, I have spent a lot of time messing around in Unity doing
                    game development.  In the past couple years, I have worked on a lot of mini projects that I hope
                    can one day go into some kind of game.  Some projects I have done include making a lincoln log
                    build system, building railways using splines, making a replica of Minecraft, creating maps from
                    Earth terrain, gear simulation, and building components for a marble machine.  I have also spent
                    some time working in Blender doing 3d modeling.  One day I hope to have more time to go down the
                    rabbit hole on a project and make something cool.
